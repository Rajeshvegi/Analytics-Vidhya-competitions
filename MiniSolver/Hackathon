Problem Statement
We, digital publication house, require your help. We have a number of articles on multiple topics / category related to general knowledge, practical well being, sports, health and others written by distinguished authors in these fields. We are doing an analysis of our readers and trying to build a better platform for our followers.

One of the biggest challenge we face is that when a user comes to our portal, we pick a random article from our database and suggest it to them. We want to now understand our readers better, and recommend an article which he/she is more likely to read. 

Currently, users have an option to rate articles after reading the article. We have given the train dataset having rating on articles by users, now it is your task to predict how much would the user like an article (give star) in test data set.
